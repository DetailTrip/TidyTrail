# 🧹 TidyTrails Audit — `ReviewStep.tsx`

🔍 **Summary**  
The final step in the booking flow allows users to review their details, optionally apply the prepay discount, and confirm their booking. It consolidates all booking data, performs final validation via `fullBookingSchema`, and calculates pricing using `calculatePricing`. The submission is sent via `useBookAppointment`. The component is structurally solid, but contains a critical oversight: the enzyme cleaner fee is excluded from the total for recurring bookings. Minor refactors are also suggested to reduce pricing duplication and improve error handling.

## 📦 Component Function

- Displays a summary via `<BookingSummary />`
- Allows the user to toggle prepay (10% discount) if on a recurring plan
- Validates all data with `fullBookingSchema.parse()`
- Computes total price and submits booking via `mutate(payload)`
- Navigates to thank-you page on success
- Shows a server error message if submission fails

---

## 🧠 BookingContext Usage

- Reads `bookingData` for all values (frequency, address, dog count, etc.)
- Writes only `prepaySelected` via `updateBooking()`
- Uses up-to-date context for pricing and submission payload
- Context-backed state ensures that any changes made by jumping back steps are reflected on return

**⚠️ Note:**  
- Data is not reset after success — booking info remains in memory and localStorage
  - **Fix:** Clear context/localStorage after successful submission to prevent stale reuse

---

## ✅ Zod Form Validation

- Calls `fullBookingSchema.parse(bookingData)` before submission
- Catches and logs error, then alerts user with “Please double-check your form...”
- Relies on step-level validation having already occurred (this is a fallback)
- ❗ `dogCount` is not validated by schema — missing from `serviceSelectionSchema`, so it's absent in `fullBookingSchema`
  - **Fix:** Add `dogCount: z.number().min(1)` to schema

**⚠️ Alert UX:**  
- Uses native `alert()` for error, which may not be screen-reader accessible
  - **Fix:** Replace with an on-page error box (`aria-live="polite"`) for consistency

---

## 💸 Pricing & Discounts Logic

- Calculates pricing with `calculatePricing(bookingData)`
- Applies:
  - Dog surcharge
  - Waste surcharge (if one-time)
  - Add-ons (only for one-time)
  - 10% prepay discount (if selected)
  - $10 referral discount (if `referralCode` present)
- Computes final total based on frequency and options
- Submits `total_price` to DB

**🔍 Breakdown Logic:**

| Frequency      | Calculation Method                                                        |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| One-time       | `finalPricePerVisit + enzymeAddOn - referralDiscount`                    |
| Recurring      | Prepay: `monthlyTotal * 3 - referralDiscount`<br>Not prepay: `monthlyTotal - referralDiscount` |
| Prepay Flag    | Applies 10% discount to monthly total only (not per visit)                |

**⚠️ Critical Bug:**  
- `enzymeAddOn` is omitted from recurring totals
  - **Fix:** Always add `enzymeAddOn` once, even on recurring bookings

**Duplication Issue:**
- Pricing logic is repeated in both `ReviewStep` and `BookingSummary`
  - **Fix:** Centralize logic in `calculateFinalTotal()` utility or refactor `calculatePricing` to return complete totals

## ♿ Accessibility (WCAG 2.1-AA)

- Interactive elements (checkbox, buttons) are keyboard accessible
- Uses `aria-live="polite"` for error messages and loading states
- Emojis are embedded with text for labels and headings (e.g. 🧾, 💸)
- Button label updates when loading ("Booking...") — good for screen readers

**Enhancement Suggestions:**
- Add `aria-label` to “Edit” buttons (e.g. `aria-label="Edit Contact Info"`)
- Replace alert() with inline error message for better assistive tech support
- Confirm that post-booking success message on ThankYou page is focusable

---

## 📱 Mobile UX

- Uses responsive layout (`max-w-xl mx-auto`, `p-6`, `space-y-10`)
- Buttons are `w-full` on small screens — easy to tap
- Summary is stacked vertically with proper spacing
- No horizontal scroll expected — summaries are short text rows
- Potential wrap issue on small screens for pricing numbers — monitor currency display

---

## ⚠️ Resilience & Edge Cases

- ❗ `dogCount` is not required in schema — could submit null to DB
- ❗ User data is not cleared after submission — risks pre-filled data on new booking
- ✅ Double-submit prevented via `disabled` Confirm button and `isLoading` state
- ✅ Error state from `useBookAppointment` mutation shown in UI with message
- ❗ Booking step is not persistent — page refresh resets wizard to step 1
  - **Enhancement:** Store `currentStep` in localStorage or query param for persistence

---

## 🧼 Clean Code & Reusability

- BookingSummary component offloads most visual layout
- Minor code duplication: pricing logic repeated between BookingSummary and ReviewStep
- Mutation/validation wrapped in try/catch — clean and effective
- Good separation of display vs mutation logic
- Props are well-typed (`goBack`, `goToStep`)
- ❗ No `resetBooking()` context method exists — would simplify clearing data post-submit

---

## 🎨 Tailwind Design Token Audit

- ✅ `text-primary`, `bg-highlight`, `border-accent`, `text-muted`, `bg-mist`, `text-secondary`
- ✅ Uses `bg-highlight` for Prepay section and `border-border` for visual dividers
- ✅ Brand colors consistent throughout summary and buttons
- ✅ `focus:ring-accent` applied on buttons for clear visual feedback
- ⚠️ Uses Tailwind default `text-blue-600` for Edit links — consider `text-secondary` for brand consistency

---

## 🔧 Actionable Fixes Summary

- [ ] Add `dogCount` to Zod schema
- [ ] Include enzyme add-on fee in recurring pricing total
- [ ] Replace `alert()` with on-page error box for failed validation
- [ ] Centralize pricing logic into shared utility
- [ ] Add `aria-label` to “Edit” buttons
- [ ] Clear booking context + localStorage after successful submission
- [ ] Consider persisting current step in wizard for better UX
- [ ] Replace `text-blue-600` with `text-secondary` for brand-aligned links

## 🛠 Refactor Level: **3.5/5**

Functionally robust and accessible, but key pricing logic (enzyme add-on) is misaligned with UI intent. Centralizing pricing and improving error handling will eliminate subtle bugs and long-term maintenance risk.
