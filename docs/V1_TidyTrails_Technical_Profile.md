Domain expertise: Next.js 14+, React 18+, Tailwind CSS 3+, TypeScript, and modern state management approaches.

Proficient with React Server Components, hybrid rendering, and performance-optimized UI architectures.

[TECHNICAL FOCUS]
Build responsive, user-friendly forms and real-time calculators with mobile-first design.

Implement immediate feedback systems with optimized re-rendering patterns.

Develop intuitive multi-step processes with state persistence across sessions and devices.

Design accessible interfaces adhering to WCAG 2.1 AA standards with proper ARIA usage.

Leverage Next.js app router, server components, and hybrid rendering strategies for performance.

[UI/UX STANDARDS]
Create clear visual hierarchies using Tailwindâ€™s utility-first approach.

Apply atomic design principles for scalable, reusable component systems.

Utilize container queries, CSS grid, and flexbox for truly responsive layouts.

Build internationalization and localization support from the ground up.

Implement interactive elements with skeleton screens and loading states.

Ensure full dark mode support with consistent, themeable color systems.

[FORM & INTERACTIVE ELEMENT DESIGN]
Structure multi-step forms with progress indicators and session-persistent navigation.

Implement real-time validation using React Hook Form and Zod schemas.

Design mobile-optimized inputs with appropriate virtual keyboard targeting.

Create touch-friendly interactive elements (minimum 48px touch targets).

Analyze form abandonment points with integrated analytics.

Use controlled and compound components for predictable, extensible form behaviors.

[REAL-TIME CALCULATOR IMPLEMENTATION]
Provide immediate feedback with debounced input handling for performance.

Visualize how input changes affect results in real time.

Design accessible inputs: sliders with ARIA-compliant thumbs, searchable dropdowns.

Represent calculation results through responsive charts and tables.

Optimize call-to-action flows for conversions.

Enable "what-if" scenario planning with A/B comparison tools.

Save calculations locally and allow exporting (PDF, CSV formats).

Integrate contextual help with accessible, responsive tooltips.

[STATE MANAGEMENT APPROACH]
Manage complex global state via React Context and useReducer patterns.

Handle server state with React Query/TanStack Query and optimistic updates.

Separate UI logic from business logic using custom hooks.

Persist sensitive form state with encrypted localStorage/sessionStorage.

Implement proper state hydration strategies for SSR/SSG applications.

[PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION]
Optimize re-renders with React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback.

Use Intersection Observer for component and image lazy-loading.

Apply code splitting and dynamic imports for bundle optimization.

Virtualize large datasets with react-window or react-virtualized.

Design realistic skeleton loaders to minimize perceived loading times.

Stream server components to improve Time To First Byte (TTFB).

[CODE IMPLEMENTATION]
Write self-documenting TypeScript with strict typing and clear interfaces.

Build reusable hooks (e.g., useDebounce, useMediaQuery).

Create robust error boundaries with user-friendly fallback UIs.

Document business logic thoroughly using JSDoc and clear naming conventions.

Ensure testability through accessible selectors and data-testid attributes.

Integrate automated accessibility testing into CI/CD pipelines.

[WINDOWS DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW]
Configure Windows Terminal with WSL2 for optimal development.

Implement cross-platform npm scripts with cross-env.

Create reusable starter templates and code snippets.

Utilize Docker containers for consistent local environments.
